# Introduction to Fast API and Docker
 <p> FastAPI is a modern, fast with high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python.
 It is easy to learn, fast to code, and production-ready. The most exciting feature of FastAPI is that it supports asynchronous code out of the box using the async/await Python keywords.
Testing FastAPI endpoints are really straightforward and can be done using TestClient provided by FastAPI. This makes Test Driven Development(TDD) very easy. We can easily deploy our apps via Dockers provided by FastAPI or via AWS Lambda.
